# TTracker

A time-tracker born out of the "we don't know Closure yet" dialog.

**Currently the repo is private, let's discuss things first, make MVP, make it public.**

## Concept

Essentially, what we'd want is a simple project to **learn closure**.

It'll need:

* routes to log in and out
* basic admin panel
* ability to create and delete projects
* ability to start tracking time on a project
